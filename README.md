# 365 days of algorithms

This repository contains implementations (as notebooks) in Python3 for a challenge inspired by Tomáš Bouda's 100 days of algorithms.

The goal of this challenge is to provide a clear (and if possible effiecient) implementation of 365 different algorithms (a new one each day).

Every piece of code is released under GNU GPL v3.0

To run any notebook on your own machine you'll need Python3, Jupyter Notebook and to close this repository (and possibly Anaconda for missing libraries).
