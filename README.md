# 365 days of algorithms

This repository contains implementations (as notebooks) in Python3 for a challenge inspired by Tomáš Bouda's 100 days of algorithms.

The goal of this challenge is to provide a clear (and if possible effiecient) implementation of 365 different algorithms (a new one each day).
