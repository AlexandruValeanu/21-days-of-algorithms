# 365 days of algorithms

This repository contains implementations (as notebooks) in Python3 for a challenge inspired by Tom치코 Bouda's 100 days of algorithms. You can check Tom치코' challenge [link](https://github.com/coells/100days).

The goal of this challenge is to provide a clear (and if possible effiecient) implementation of 365 different algorithms (a new one each day).

Every piece of code is released under GNU GPL v3.0

To run any notebook on your own machine you'll need Python3, Jupyter Notebook and to clone this repository (and possibly Anaconda for missing libraries).
